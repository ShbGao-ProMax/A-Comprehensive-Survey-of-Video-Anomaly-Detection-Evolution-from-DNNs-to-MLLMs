Mainstream Datasets
====

For various VAD tasks, the existing literature provides a wealth of publicly available datasets that encompass diverse scenarios. Specifically, these datasets range from those focused on specific scenes to those covering a wide variety of complex situations. Moreover, differences exist across datasets in terms of the number of videos, average video duration, anomaly categories, and annotation methods. In the following tables, we provide a detailed comparison of the current mainstream datasets. 

***It is worth noting that some datasets were initially designed for specific VAD tasks; however, with the continuous advancement of technology, these datasets can now also be applied to other VAD tasks.***

***For instance, any semi-supervised or weakly supervised VAD dataset can be utilized for evaluating training-free VAD methods.***

### Subway Entrance 2008

The Subway Entrance dataset is a classic benchmark in video anomaly detection, recorded at the entrance of a New York City subway station. The single long video captures commuters passing through the turnstiles, with a simple background but multiple types of anomalies: wrong direction (passing through the entrance in reverse), jumping over the turnstile, tailgating (multiple people passing with one swipe), and loitering. The dataset consists of one long video with clearly labeled anomalies, making it a common baseline for early methods and frame-level anomaly detection evaluation.

### Subway Exit 2008

The Subway Exit dataset is also collected at a New York subway station, but at the exit area. The video records people leaving the turnstiles. Anomalies include wrong direction, tailgating, and loitering. While similar to Subway Entrance, this dataset differs in viewpoint, lighting, and flow direction. It consists of one long video, with frame-level annotations, and is often used as a complementary validation set for anomaly detection methods.

### UMN 2009

The UMN dataset is a classic dataset for behavior anomaly detection, featuring three different scenes (outdoor lawn, indoor lobby, indoor hallway), each with several video clips. In each video, normal behavior (people standing or walking slowly) suddenly shifts to anomalous behavior (all people start running, simulating emergency escape). The anomaly type is single, focusing on collective behavioral changes, making it suitable for testing the sensitivity of anomaly detection algorithms. Provides frame-level annotations, without object-level labels.

### UCSD Ped1 2010

UCSD Ped1 is a landmark dataset for street surveillance anomaly detection, captured at a pathway in UC San Diego. Normal behavior is pedestrians walking in one direction; anomalies include people riding bicycles, skateboards, or vehicles entering the scene, and group running. The dataset contains 70 video clips, with both frame-level and object-level (bounding box) anomaly annotations, enabling precise localization. Its fixed scene and small background variation make it ideal for evaluating detection of small objects and motion anomalies.

### Ubnormal 2021

Ubnormal is a large-scale, multi-scene, multi-category video anomaly detection dataset released by the UPC (Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya) team in 2023. It consists of 543 videos and 236,902 frames, covering 22 categories of anomalies (such as fighting, stealing, fainting, crowd gathering, jaywalking, etc.) across various scenes (streets, malls, subways, campuses, traffic, etc.).

A key feature of Ubnormal is its pixel-level annotation, which not only marks the frames containing anomalies but also provides precise pixel-wise segmentation of the anomalous objectsâ€”an extremely rare property among anomaly datasets.

All events are also multi-label classified, supporting complex scenarios where multiple anomalies may occur simultaneously. Ubnormal is suitable for anomaly detection, localization, video segmentation, and action recognition tasks, making it one of the most comprehensive and challenging benchmarks in video anomaly detection.

The dataset does not include audio.
