# A-Comprehensive-Survey-of-Video-Anomaly-Detection-Evolution-from-DNNs-to-MLLMs
This is a supplementary resource to “A Comprehensive Survey of Video Anomaly Detection: Evolution from DNNs to MLLMs”. 

Here, we provide an overview of the most commonly used evaluation metrics and datasets in the field of VAD, as well as detailed explanations and major examples of different types of VAD methods. In addition, we will continuously maintain this project and promptly incorporate the latest VAD papers into our framework for researchers' reference.
